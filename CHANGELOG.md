## 0.7.0 (2025-08-19)

Feature release with some architectural rework.

**ðŸ’¥ Breaking changes**

The low-level `EditGrid` component no longer accepts a `getItemValidationSchema` prop. This has been

schema depending on the currently visible fields.

- [`#73`][#73] Implemented the `content` component type, now built on top of the `utrecht-html` NL
  Design System component.
- [`#59`][#59] Added support for the `clearOnHide` component configuration option.
- [`#101`][#101] Implemented the `licenseplate` component type.
- [`#109`][#109] Implemented the `textarea` component type.
- [`#103`][#103] Implemented the `number` component type.

**Bugfixes**

- [`#133`][#133], [`#141`][#141] Fixed two situations where infinite renders could happen with
  nested edit grids.

**Project maintenance**

- Added CI check for outdated i18n messages.
- [`#127`][#127] Upgraded to Storybook 9.
- [`#127`][#127] Added code coverage instrumentation and reporting.
