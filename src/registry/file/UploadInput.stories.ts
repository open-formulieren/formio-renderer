/**
 * @note I have not been succesful in writing interaction tests for the D&D interaction,
 * despite available documentation. Something seems to go wrong when trying to create/pass
 * a `DataTransfer` object, which clears the files and react-dropzone doesn't "see" any
 * files being dropped, so nothing fires.
 *
 * Upstream documentation: https://react-dropzone.js.org/#testing, which does not work
 * because of: https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/issues/1350 and
 * manually creating the DataTransfer instance loses information somewhere along the
 * way.
