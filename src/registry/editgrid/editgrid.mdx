# Developer documentation

Formio editgrids are quite different from the usual Formio components and require some special
attention and implementation details. This documentation describes those peculiarities so that
future developers understand what is going on.

## Quick recap

The link between a formio component and the submission data is the `key` property:

```json
{
  "type": "textfield",
  "key": "parent.child"
}
```

results in a submission data shape of:

```ts
interface SubmissionData {
  parent: {
    child: string;
  };
}
```

i.e. the `.` is used to denote nodes in a "json path" describing where values get assigned. The
component type directly maps to the data type of the value.

## Editgrid data types

Edit grids are a form of data/composite components - they hold submission data themselves and the
values come from the component definitions inside. Fieldsets and columns are similar in the sense
that they require child components to be defined, but they are layout components and don't
contribute to the submission themselves at all, unlike editgrids.

For example, an editgrid definition:

```json
{
  "type": "editgrid",
  "key": "items",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "textfield",
      "key": "parent.child"
    }
  ]
}
```

maps to the following submission data shape:

```ts
interface SubmissionData {
  items: Array<{
    parent: {
      child: string;
    };
  }>;
}
```

Note that:

- the `key` of the editgrid itself is present in the submission data, and it acts as a container
- the value type of the editgrid itself is array/list rather than an object. Each item in the edit
  grid is an item in this list.
- the usual semantics about periods in key names of the child components apply.

The components definition inside the editgrid definition acts as a blueprint for each item added to
the editgrid itself.

## Simple conditionals

Formio supports simple conditionals (and complex ones too, but we don't expose those) which allow
you to define at the component level when it should be visible or hidden. You do this by pointing to
a reference component, the desired state and the trigger value to apply the desired state.

For example, an item inside the editgrid can be conditionally visible based on the value of a
component outside of it:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "textfield",
    "key": "parent.nested"
  },
  "type": "editgrid",
  "key": "items",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "textfield",
      "key": "editgridText",
      "conditional": {
        "show": false,
        "when": "parent.nested",
        "eq": "hide editgrid text"
      }
    }
  ]
]
```

- when the outer text field has a value different from `hide editgrid text`, the textfield inside
  each editgrid item will be visible
- when the outer text field has a value equal to `hide editgrid text`, the textfield inside each
  editgrid item will be hidden

The above example is already non-trivial - it illustrates that an item inside the edit grid can have
behaviour dependent on components in the whole form definition (referring to items in the root in
this case). We will now describe more complex cases that are supported/implemented.

### Simple conditionals "local" to the edit grid item

Instead of (or at the same time as) referring to other form components, you can also make the simple
conditional logic dependent on any of the sibling components inside each edit grid item. Each item
acts like it's an isolated subform with its own local scope. This makes it possible to reach
different (visual) states for different items inside the same edit grid component. Consider the
following definition:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "textfield",
    "key": "parent.nested"
  },
  {
    "type": "editgrid",
    "key": "items",
    "components": [
      {
        "type": "textfield",
        "key": "reference"
      },
      {
        "type": "textfield",
        "key": "conditionallyVisible",
        "conditional": {
          "show": false,
          "when": "items.reference",
          "eq": "hide other"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

- the editgrid itself will always be visible
- the reference textfield in each item is always visible
- the second textfield in each item is only visible when the reference _in the same item_ has a
  value different from `hide other`

This means that you may have two or more items in an edit grid where each item shows a different
subset of fields. You can of course combine this with the earlier case and refer to components
outside of the edit grid.

**Why does this work?**

It may have caught your eye already, but the reference in the conditional doesn't simply point to
the key `reference` - instead, it points to `items.reference` - making up a fully qualified "access
path" from the root of the form definition to the individual item. This path doesn't make any sense
outside of an edit grid item, where you would have to use indexed access because of the array type
of the value: `items.3.reference`.

In the scope of each edit grid item, the actual value of the editgrid component is shadowed by the
values of the item itself, as if there are no other items at all. The type of the value changes from
array to object. _Inside_ the edit grid item, the submission data type is:

```ts
interface SubmissionData {
  parent: {
    nested: string;
  };
  items: {
    parent: {
      child: string;
    };
  };
}
```

_and_ this is merged together with the root/parent values of the submission data.

### Nested editgrids

Formio form definitions are just JSON-trees where each node is a component definition. As such, it
is _technically_ possible to nest editgrids inside of other editgrids, without any depth limits.

The following definition:

```json
{
  "type": "editgrid",
  "key": "outer",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "textfield",
      "key": "child"
    },
    {
      "type": "editgrid",
      "key": "inner",
      "components": [
        {
          "type": "textfield",
          "key": "grandchild"
        },
        {
          "type": "textfield",
          "key": "parent.child"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

maps to the submission data shape:

```ts
interface SubmissionData {
  outer: Array<{
    child: string;
    inner: Array<{
      grandchild: string;
      parent: {
        child: string;
      };
    }>;
  }>;
}
```

The same simple conditional semantics apply here, like above - you need to take into account the
path from the root of the definition by prefixing all the parent keys:

- to have conditionals relative between grandchildren, use `outer.inner.grandchild` as reference
- to have conditionals between children, use `outer.child` as reference

You can mix and match this to address the root, children and grandchildren from each node.

**Why does this work?**

Each edit grid item has its own Formik context, so as far as an item is concerned, nothing around or
above it exists. When you click the "Save" button for an item, a submit event is fired and that
triggers an update in the parent component values.

Nested edit grids result in nested Formik contexts, each resulting in its own "values" scope. When
processing the simple conditionals, we look at the parent values scope for each item before setting
up the scope for the item itself, and merge them together with the fully qualified item paths (e.g.
`outer.inner.parent.child`). Each level of nesting results in an assignment to the corresponding
level in the submission data structure.

We track this submission data state itself in a React context so that we _do_ know for each item
whether there exist things "above it", and that gives each item access to the parent scopes all the
way up to the root.

An XML structure can represent this a bit more visually pleasing:

```xml
<rootScope key="">
  <outerScope key="outer">
    <itemScope key="inner">
      <itemField 1 />
      <itemField 2 />
      <itemField ... />
      <itemField n />
    </itemScope>
  </outerScope>
</rootScope>
```
