# Modal

The modal uses the native HTML dialog element with all its features.

To open the modal, we need a useEffect hook. The dialog element does support a `open` property, but
this can only be used to show the dialog without modal functionalities.

Opening the modal automatically sets the correct aria-tags. Also, the close button get autofocus,
making closing the modal easier for vision-impaired users.

The modal can be closed using the `[esc]` key, or by clicking the "close" button on the top-right of
the modal.
