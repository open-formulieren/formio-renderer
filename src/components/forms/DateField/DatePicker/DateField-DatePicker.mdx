# DateField - datepicker

## Date picker widget

The date picker widget is suitable for nearby dates (in the future or past).

A calendar component is appropriate because:

- you can display occupied dates and/or date ranges
- you can indicate the current date
- it is not expected that the user needs to click the year/month button too many times

We aim to make it accessible to assistive technology and keyboard-only navigation. Note that it is
currently not possible yet to navigate inside the calendar using the arrow keys.

## Widget prop

Use the prop `widget="datepicker"` to use this widget.

<Canvas of={DatepickerStories.DatePicker} story={{height: '60ex'}} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={DateField} />

**DatePicker props**

Internally, the `DateField` uses the `DatePicker` widget.

<ArgTypes of={DatePicker} />

## No asterisks

The backend can be configured to treat fields as required by default and instead mark optional
fields explicitly.

<Canvas of={DatepickerStories.NoAsterisksForRequired} />
