# DateField - input group

## Memorable dates

Memorable dates are dates that users can easily remember, such as a date of birth or marriage.

To avoid users having to scroll/click a lot in calendar widgets, it's recommended to use the input
group widget where they can enter numbers for day, month and year.

## Widget prop

Use the prop `widget="inputGroup"` to use this widget.

<Canvas of={InputGroupStories.InputGroup} />
