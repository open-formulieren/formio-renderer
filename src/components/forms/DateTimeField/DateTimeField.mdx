# DateTimeField

The datetime field consists of a text input with a floating widget that toggles when focussing the
field. This floating widget contains a calendar where a date can be selected, and a time input where
a time can be selected. Suitable for nearby dates such as appointments.

A calendar component is appropriate because:

- you can display occupied dates and/or date ranges
- you can indicate the current date
- it is not expected that the user needs to click the year/month button too many times

We aim to make it accessible to assistive technology and keyboard-only navigation. Note that it is
currently not possible yet to navigate inside the calendar using the arrow keys.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={DateTimeField} />

## No asterisks

The backend can be configured to treat fields as required by default and instead mark optional
fields explicitly.
