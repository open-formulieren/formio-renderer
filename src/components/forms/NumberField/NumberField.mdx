# Number inputs

Numeric inputs are essential for some types of data, but using the correct inputs is rather hard due
to a couple of reasons:

- some data looks numeric, but actually isn't
- associated validations (minimum and maximum values)
- accessibility concerns (especially when silently truncating or ignoring data)
- localisation - different locales use different decimal separators

The implementation of our `NumberField` component attempts to address these, and has taken certain
sources into account when doing so

- [GOV.UK](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/)

Our numeric input allows entering arbitrary numbers - decimals, negative, large, small... They take
the current locale into account and present formatted numbers. E.g. in the NL locale, the `.`
decimal separator will be converted to a comma, while thousand groups are automatically formatted
with a period.

Only numerical keyboard entries are allowed.

The developer/form designers are responsible for defining validation rules for the values to express
minimum/maximum values.

## Locale

## Validation errors

<Canvas of={NumberFieldStories.ValidationError} />

## No asterisks

The backend can be configured to treat fields as required by default and instead mark optional
fields explicitly.

## Additional notes

Do not use the `NumberField` for inputs such as SSN, credit card, phone numbers - instead use a
`TextField`, possibly with `inputmode="numeric"` and `pattern=[0-9]+` props.

This kind of data is actually just text inputs/strings that happen to consist only of digits. As a
rule of thumb, if leading zeroes are significant, you should use a `TextField` instead.
