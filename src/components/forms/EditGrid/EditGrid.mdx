# Edit grid

An edit grid allows editing arrays of items where each item has the same shape. The `EditGrid`
component manages adding and removing individual items.

The state is intended to be managed via Formik's
[FieldArray](https://formik.org/docs/api/fieldarray).

<Canvas of={EditGridStories.Default} />

## Usage

The edit grid component roughly follow Formio's `editgrid` type, but we have some additional
flexibility.

**Controlling extra items**

The prop `emptyItem` controls what will be added to the form state when the "Add another" button is
clicked. This means that you can actually (depending on form state) add different items each time,
as long as the shape stays consistent.

Pass `null` to disable adding extra rows/items.

<Canvas of={EditGridStories.WithoutAddButton} />

**Nested item type**

The component is generic, so if you know upfront what the shape of the data is, you can pass that as
a generic type argument for improved type checking. This can be particularly useful when rendering
the `EditGrid` low-level component in your own Formik state.

```tsx
<EditGrid<MyItemData>
  name="myItems"
  emptyItem={{thisShape: 'is', typeChecked: true}}
  {...otherProps}
/>
```

**Isolation mode**

To replicate Formio's editing behaviour, the isolation mode via `enableIsolation` is available. In
this mode, edits to an item are only updated into the main form state after an explicit save action.
This save button is _only_ available when `enableIsolation: true`, as it would otherwise be
confusing.

<Canvas of={EditGridStories.WithIsolation} />

## Props

**EditGrid**

<ArgTypes of={EditGridStories} />

**EditGridItem**

This component is rendered automatically by `EditGrid` based on the `items` prop it receives.

<ArgTypes of={EditGridItemStories} />
