# FormioForm

The `FormioForm` component is high level API of this package. Given a formio form definition (as a
list of component definitions), it renders the form fields for it.

Pass the `values` prop to initialize it, e.g. if you have user input that was persisted in some
backend before. `values` are merged with (and override) the default values extracted for each
component in the definition.

The `onSubmit` callback receives the entered form values when the HTML form is submitted.
