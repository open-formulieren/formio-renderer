# Button theming

The `button` component uses the `utrecht-button` component under the hood, implying you can use
those
[design tokens](https://nl-design-system.github.io/utrecht/storybook/?path=/story/css_css-button--design-tokens).

## Open Forms overrides

The default Open Forms theme overrides the button styles. You don't get these overrides unless you
use the `.openforms-theme`.

- Top and left border are transparent for a "3D-effect".
- Buttons inside tables have their background color and padding removed.
- On mobile viewports, the button is made full-width with centered content.

There are no additional design tokens.
