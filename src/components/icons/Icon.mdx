# Icons

Icons are essential in user interfaces. At the time of writing, the Formio renderer only supports
Font Awesome icons, but we organise the code so that future support of other icon libraries is not
out of the question.

The project that uses the formio renderer and its icons is responsible for properly loading the Font
Awesome font assets - we only produce markup with the correct accesibility attributes and class
names to display the icons correctly.
